These scripts require that Ruby, Python, and OpenFST are
installed.

The following is a list of valid calls:

To analyze Alice in Wonderland:
ruby mainscript.rb alice_tokenized.txt alice_merged.txt 1
ruby mainscript.rb alice_tokenized.txt alice_merged.txt 2

To analyze Persuasion by Jane Austen:
ruby mainscript.rb austen_tokenized.txt austen_merged.txt 1
ruby mainscript.rb austen_tokenized.txt austen_merged.txt 2

To analyze Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad:
ruby mainscript.rb conrad_tokenized.txt conrad_merged.txt 1
ruby mainscript.rb conrad_tokenized.txt conrad_merged.txt 2

To analyze The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain:
ruby mainscript.rb twain_tokenized.txt twain_merged.txt 1
ruby mainscript.rb twain_tokenized.txt twain_merged.txt 2

For all the above calls, the argument "1" will analyze the text 
for all the most common words in the Brown corpus.

For all the above calls, the argument "2" will analyze the text
for all the most common words in the Brown corpus with length 
greater than 1.  Essentially, this excludes only the words "a"
and "i" and tends to produce better results.

When any of the above calls are called, the script will produce
the precision and f-scores for dictionaries of size 25, 50, 75,
100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, and 375.

Each run of the script generates extra files (example file names
are 11611950_a.txt, 1161925_geq_b.fst, etc).  If you plan to run
the script multiple times, it is best to delete these files
between runs to ensure that everything still runs correctly.

Also included is a script for the transducer that includes data
about unigram probabilities.  This transducer only uses option 2.
To run this script, use the following calls:

ruby mainscript_unigrams.rb alice_tokenized.txt alice_merged.txt
ruby mainscript_unigrams.rb austen_tokenized.txt austen_merged.txt
ruby mainscript_unigrams.rb conrad_tokenized.txt conrad_merged.txt
ruby mainscript_unigrams.rb twain_tokenized.txt twain_merged.txt

Again, the unigram scripts generate extra files.  If you plan to run
the script multiple times, it is best to delete the extra files 
between runs to ensure that everything still runs correctly.
